# Moving-LED
This code will help us understand various types of registers involved in low level programming.

It is a priveledge to work with various IDEs nowadays however to understand how the whole system is actually working, we need to understand these registers and modes used. How the LEDs are assigned how the GPIOs are working, how to constantly look at the reference manuals etc are some of the things that are being taught in the project.

The main function here is that the LED will work according to the shofting of the STM32 board. We are going to calculate the angles and use coordinates to make our LEDs glow according to the orientation of our board. This at the end looks like the board is working according to the gravity however its just some basic mathematical formula and calcuations involved.

Studying this code made me understand the basic working and controls of a Microcontroller.
